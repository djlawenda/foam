## Note

Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Specifically, they can describe:

What containerized applications are running (and on which nodes)
The resources available to those applications
The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance
