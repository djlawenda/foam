A combination of [[user]], [[cluster name]] and [[namespace]]. A convenient way to
switch between combinations of permissions and restrictions. 

For example you may have a development cluster and a production cluster, or may be
part of both the operations and architecture namespaces. This
information is referenced from \~/.kube/config.
